# Game of Life

A terminal UI implementation of [John Conway's Game of Life](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It isn't meant to be efficient, pretty or anything: it was born out of pure boredom.

## How to run

There are some examples on `examples/`, which you can run using Cargo. For instance, to run the [glider](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)) example:

```shell
$ cargo run --example glider 
```
